		<h1>Itinerary Atlas</h1>
		<p>Itinerary Atlas is a quarter-long project for (IN4MATX 132) Projects in HCI
			Evaluations at UCI. I worked with four classmates to research and evaluate a
			potential application to help travelers of all experience levels plan their
			next adventures and share their stories with each other.</p>
		<p>As the team scribe, I documented our weekly progress and meetings. I
			conducted competitive analyses and two interviews for our UX research. </p>

		<h2>PROBLEM</h2>
		<p>With the drop in Covid-19 restrictions there is a huge surge in travel, but
			what if you never traveled, are new to travelling, or an experienced traveler
			but need ideas? Some itinerary planners assume you already know everything you
			want in your trip, whilst travel forums may be inconsistent in quality and
			validity with their feedback and recommendations.</p>

		<h2>SOLUTION</h2>
		<p>Itinerary Atlas is an application that consolidates trusted reviews and
			itineraries into one community forum for new and experienced travelers to
			share their tips and tricks for a great trip without the stress of having
			to use multiple platforms for researching and travel planning.</p>

		<h2>PROCESS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Week 1: </strong>Brainstorm app ideas and identify the audience.</li>
			<li><strong>Week 2: </strong>Ideate what resources we want for our app.</li>
			<li><strong>Week 3: </strong>Conduct competitive analysis research on current travel planning resources.</li>
			<li><strong>Week 4: </strong>Conduct literature reviews about the behavior of travelers & psychology of tourism.</li>
			<li><strong>Week 5: </strong>Conduct interviews with new & experienced travelers.</li>
			<li><strong>Week 6: </strong>Brainstorm functions and corresponding functions.</li>
			<li><strong>Week 7: </strong>Develop wireframes.</li>
			<li><strong>Week 8: </strong>Present design & findings.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Brainstorming & Ideation</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Consider new and experienced travelers' perspectives when planning itineraries.</li>
			<li>What do they struggle with? What makes travel planning difficult? How do you
				find the good places to visit and at what times?</li>
			<li>How can we create a platform to provide ALL travelers with an easy way to plan their next adventure?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Purpose</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Understand what features make our competitors successful and how we can make Itinerary Atlas unique.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Findings</li>
					<!--<img>-->
						<ul>
							<li>The Reddi​t and Rick Steve Forums are specifically tailored for users to leave comments and respond to
								comments, so they pass all of the features we examined.</li>
							<li>Wanderlog and Planify,io, on the contrary, do not have a comment feature, just planning services./li>
						</ul>
					<li>Conclusion</li>
						<ul>
							<li>We need to establish trust through a community base & provide organization through itinerary planning.</li>
							<li>We need to bridge the navigation between forums and traveling planning resources.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

			<li><strong>Literature Reviews</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Purpose</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Understand the psychology of travelers with different cultural backgrounds, ages, and traveling experiences.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Findings</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Travelers often feel stressed having to use multiple platforms to research tourist attractions, find affordable
								places to stay, and use a sharable platform to consolidate all itinerary information.​</li>
							<li>Cultural differences impact how users research for places to visit.</li>
							<li>Language barriers often discourage travelers from visiting certain places.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Conclusion</li>
						<ul>
							<li>We need to ensure inclusivity to minimize language and cultural barriers.</li>
							<li>We need to solidify intuitive design in order for all users of different language and cultural backgrounds
								to have easy navigation throughout the app.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

			<li><strong>Interviews</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Purpose</li>
						<ul>
							<li>We interviewed two potential users of different demographics and travel experiences to understand what they would need to more efficient travel planning.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Findings</li>
						<ul>
							<li>For solo trips, our interviewees appreciated the freedom to do things on their own timelines & have some leniency in their travel schedules.</li>
							<li>For group trips, our interviewees feel more pressured to find tourist attractions that everyone in the group would enjoy. </li>
							<li>“Rather than being just a consumer of content, I can create honest content.” - Interviewee 2</li>
							<ul>
								<li>This reminded me that users prioritize trust when looking at reviews for accommodations, points of interest, and more travel factors.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					<li>Conclusion</li>
						<ul>
							<li>We need to ensure trust and accessibility for our users in order to reduce stress when travel planning.​</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

			<h1>Recipe Radar</h1>
			<p>Recipe Radar is an app designed and prototyped in Figma to help college
				students find easy recipes that fit their dietary needs and schedule time
				to cook the recipes in a customizable meal prep timeline.</p>
			<p><strong>The project won third place overall out of nine teams in
				Design@UCI’s quarterly project competition in Spring 2023.</strong></p>
			<p>As the Project Manager, I ensured that our team met consistently, completed
				tasks in a timely manner, and followed cohesive interface designs and
				intuitive user flows.</p>

			<h2>PROBLEM</h2>
			<p>College students have a hard time, finding time in their busy schedules to
				meal prep and cook healthy meals at home. </p>

			<h2>SOLUTION</h2>
			<p>Create a fun and accessible application that caters to the users dietary
				needs. Provide meal prepping recipes that can be stored for later use. </p>

			<h2>PROCESS</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Week 1: </strong>Brainstorm app ideas and identify the audience.</li>
				<li><strong>Week 2: </strong>Ideate what resources we want for our app.</li>
				<li><strong>Week 3: </strong>Conduct competitive analysis research on current meal prepping apps.</li>
				<li><strong>Week 4: </strong>Distribute meal prep survey. Mimic the experience of looking up recipes.</li>
				<li><strong>Week 5: </strong>Brainstorm functions and corresponding functions.</li>
				<li><strong>Week 6: </strong>Working on mid fidelity wireframes.</li>
				<li><strong>Week 7: </strong>Working on high fidelity wireframes & prototyping.</li>
				<li><strong>Week 8: </strong>Conduct usability testing & revise accordingly.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Brainstorming & Ideation</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Considered problems that college students face in regard to healthy eating.</li>
				<li>Brainstormed how meal prepping works.</li>
				<li>How college students typically meal prep.</li>
				<li>How would we want meal prepping to be easier for ourselves.</li>
			</ul>

								<li>25% of respondents have completely different allergies and food restrictions from each other.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>We need to develop an intuitive design to encourage users to meal plan at their own pace and schedule.</li>
								<li>We need a questionnaire to capture each user's food preferences and dietary restrictions because there is an infinite amount of possibilities of what users can and cannot eat.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>

				<li><strong>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</strong></li>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Purpose: </strong>Compare meal prepping apps on the market & note similar features between apps</li>

								<li><strong>Available Resources: </strong>Competitor B considers users' kitchen appliances & cooking utensils​</li>
								<li><strong>Scheduling: </strong>Competitor C groups recipes for users to prioritize meal planning​</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>We need our application to incorporate all of the mentioned key features to widen our target audience and their needs.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>

				<li><strong>BECOME THE USER</strong></li>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Purpose: </strong>Mimic user’s perspective when searching for recipes</li>
						<li><strong>Process</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Noted information hierarchy</li>
								<li>What features we liked and disliked</li>
								<li>Considered how we could enhance this experience through our product</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>We need to ensure straightforward information organization and visualization in the application design.</li>
							</ul>
